    <div class="pageItem">

        <p>
            UNCG is surrounded by a variety of restaurants and spots that offer everything from quick bites to sit down 
            meals. In my own experience, some are better than others, but it can be hard to tell which ones are worth it 
            until you try them yourself. To make that easier, I’ve put together a straightforward guide based on real 
            visits and honest impressions. I’ll point out standout dishes, flag a few misses, and share quick tips like 
            price range, busy hours, and overall vibe. I’m here to help you find the best food on and around campus without 
            asting time, or your appetite.

        <h3>Side Notes</h3>
    </header>
    <div class="pageItem">
        <p>
            I would like to add that these reviews are all subjective, and there are far more menu items than just what I have listed for each restaruant. I encourage you to go try
            these out for yourself!
            <br>
            <br>
            With that said, I want to note that as a student, some resturants will get you more bang for your buck than others. Most specifically, East Coast Wings & Grill offers the best 
            promotions and offers for students than the other 2 restaurants. Out of the three, Boba Bee is the worst in that department, but because they are primarily a beverage establishment, 
            you will be spending less than what you would at the other two places. One final note that I have is that both Don Galas and East Coast Wings do take flex, so for students who stay on 
            campus, these are great options!
